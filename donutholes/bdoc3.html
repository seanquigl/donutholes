<p class='poemtitle'>Bird-dog of the century</p>
<p class='poemstanza'>On the day the sun exploded we were all underneath a big white tent<br>
in the golden field where they give out the award <br>
for the bird-dog of the century.<br>
It was a brilliantine day, <br>
a softiness day, <br>
a rexentide day. </p>
<p class='poemstanza'>Sadie, of course, looked magnificent barking.<br>
And you were looking great in your shorts.  <br>
It was a crystalpuff day, <br>
a cinnahot day, <br>
a respiffient day.</p>
<p class='poemstanza'>We heard singing from the distant rooftops where we bought our bread at. <br>
We were standing in the field under the tent waiting for Sadie to receive her award <br>
for being the bird-dog of the century. <br>
You told Sadie she was a good dog.<br>
It was true.<br>
It was a wispious day,<br>
a bummykins day,<br>
a flyerrod, sizzlehawk, schrumpadump day. <br>
